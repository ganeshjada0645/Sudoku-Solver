# Sudoku-Solver
This C++ program solves a Sudoku puzzle using a backtracking algorithm. It takes an input grid representing an unsolved Sudoku puzzle and finds a valid solution. The program uses recursion and a constraint-checking function to determine the correct values for each cell in the Sudoku grid.

Key Features:

• Input: Accepts a 9x9 grid as input, representing the unsolved Sudoku puzzle. Empty cells are denoted by '*'.
• Constraint Checking: Implements a function to check if a particular value is valid in a given cell based on Sudoku rules.
• Backtracking: Utilizes a recursive backtracking algorithm to explore possible solutions and find the correct values for each cell.
• Solution Display: Outputs the solved Sudoku grid to the console.


This Sudoku Solver program provides a functional implementation of solving Sudoku puzzles. It can be used to solve various Sudoku puzzles by providing the input grid as an argument. This code can be added to GitHub as a standalone project or as part of a collection of algorithms and puzzle solvers.
